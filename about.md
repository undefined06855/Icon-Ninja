Liked Fruit Ninja, and wanted a similar experience in GD? Well now you can, right from the main menu! Now icons fly up from the bottom of the screen, which you can swipe to kill, just like in Fruit Ninja! \
Don't like the custom physics? Disable them, along with gameplay, right in the mod settings!

Idea from Alphalaneous, see [this discord message](https://discord.com/channels/911701438269386882/911702535373475870/1303111747539963905)! \
Bomb sprite by dasshu!

Planned Features:
- Customisable swords (based on player colours, perhaps)
- Leaderboards
- Screen shake
Suggest features and report bugs at the github link in the bottom left!
